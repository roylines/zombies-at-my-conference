## Zombies at my Conference
# Node Knockout 2013 Entry

Have you ever wondered what would happen if the zombie apocalypse began whilst you were at a conference? Would you survive? Would you risk your life drinking free beer, or just run away?

Zombies at my conference is a multiplayer zombie simulation where you select a conference to watch as the battle between zombies and humans plays out. You can add and move free beer around the map to attract humans and you can play Dubstep to attract zombies (you knew zombies love Dubstep didn't you). Who do you want to win? Now's your chance to finish off that annoying fella you met at NodeConfEU, or rescue all your friends from the Great British Node Conference.
